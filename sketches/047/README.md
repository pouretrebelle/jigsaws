# 047

I loved the direction 046 went in so I wanted to turn that up to the max. I increased the number and size of the rotating circles which resulted in a lot more refraction, akin to shattered glass. Although I think this made a more attractive overall design, the level of chaos in each piece made them much harder to align. It was easy to group pieces by size and colour but within each large area pairing up the pieces was a guessing game.
