# 033

Evolving from 032, this design renders the same program with five times the number of layers. As in previous designs each colour is offset half of the width between the bars, which in this case means the colours alternate between the bars and the gaps between them, creating a sort of striped collage of two conflicting patterns. Because the layers are painted on so many times they become almost opaque, revealing swathes of shapes across the design. I love how the build up of different colours create prismatic, multi-tonal vistas.

I thought this jigsaw would be quite boring to solve because it's so reliant on colour rather than also using texture and shape, but the duotone nature of each piece added a really interesting dimension because it wasn't clear which colour to sort by. I was also slowed down by the [contrast effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect), it was much harder to compare colours by sight when the other half of the pieces had alternative, contrasting colours. Overall a very pleasurable puzzle to solve despite its linearity.
