# 037

The design for this puzzle uses a very similar algorithm to 036 but by using strokes instead of fills the outcome has a very different aesthetic. The grid of rosettes has only three rows and columns, but with some offset by half a unit and rotating in the opposite direction, the clashing lines lead to a lot of variation in the design of each of the pieces.

Continuing to play with the format of a standard puzzle grid, this jigsaw has horizontal slashes across the layout, resulting in about half the board being edge pieces.

I felt that the unusual piece layout didn't have a huge effect on the solve of this puzzle because of the clarity of the design. Since 026 the orientation of the pieces has been at odds to the design (diagonal grid with a square-derived design or vice versa), but here the clearest motifs in the design were the vertical and horizontal lines which align with the piece orientation, making it much easier to follow the lines between the pieces and reducing the distraction of the edge pieces.
