# 016

Evolving from 015, the strokes on each layer are positioned using noise, creating clusters of strokes across the design.

This also introduces a generative colour palette; the hue and brightness are selected using noise, light layers use a 'multiply' blend mode and dark colours use 'screen', creating really unique and beautiful intersections between the strokes.

I found this much more pleasant to solve than 015 because of how the colours are grouped across the design.
