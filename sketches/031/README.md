# 031

![canvas](https://res.cloudinary.com/abstract-puzzles/image/upload/w_2000/031_rbk-ugr_uha-vuq-alm?raw=true)

This design was inspired by a glitch I found when I was developing 030 where instead of drawing a single bar from the start of the active area it would start a new bar on every row. This creates waterfalls of colour which gradate across the design.

With this piece I found it easy to focus on the central clusters of colour rather than line up the outer edge. It was great fun to assemble areas of bars and then figure out how they all fit together. Because of the varying bar sizes some pieces had two different colours of stripes on them which was a handy but subtle indication to help solve the puzzle.
