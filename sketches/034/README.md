This series of designs uses the same structure of a cartesian grid and noise-generated areas of shapes that I've been employing since 026. This time the shape is a diamond that recursively shrinks and rotates 45 degrees based on the depth of the noise in an area. I set the scale so the squares and diamonds fit inside each other, and alternate between screen and multiply blend modes to make little orthogonal rosettes. I filled the gaps between the outer layer of diamonds with square rosettes.

The cut on this puzzle returns to a cartesian grid last seen in 025, but with seven rectangular pieces across the design, resulting in about one and a half as many edge pieces. This layout discouraged me from solving the outer frame first but it was still quite easy to group by the shapes and colours on the pieces so the overall solve wasn't very disrupted by the odd layout.
