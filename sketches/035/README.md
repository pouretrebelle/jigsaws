# 035

This puzzle is a slight variation on 034 with a much more dense, zoomed-out design. The cut layout has a series of small 2×2 puzzles inside of it, so there are about 30 corner pieces and more edge pieces than plain pieces.

I began by solving each of the 2×2 puzzles and then focusing on areas of the most distinctive patterns, fitting the 2×2s in as I went. It was difficult to remove the association of edge pieces equalling the outside of the puzzle, and disorienting to connect edge pieces to plain pieces, but I found the challenge really engaging.
