# 030

In a return to simpler forms, this design combines the layering effect of 028 with clusters of vertical bars. Each group of strokes has slightly varied opacities running across it so the colours vary across the design.

Building on the diagonal puzzle pattern first introduced in 026, this refactors the cutting algorithm and adds new corner shapes and five-sided edge pieces. I wanted to make all the pieces roughly the same size without compromising the layout. It's now much easier to line the edges up but as they can't be attached to form a frame you're still encouraged to work outwards from the middle of the puzzle.

My solve on this puzzle was haphazard - I started by grouping the darkest colours and connecting some of the more distinct areas of colour which led to lots of small islands of connected pieces. I leaned quite heavily on lining up the edges which was a bit of a crutch, and then connected the pieces as I saw them without much of a strategy. I think this design had a really good balance of colours and textures, but my solve didn't do it justice.
