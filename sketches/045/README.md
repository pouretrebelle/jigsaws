I've been thinking about different ways to add visual complexity to an otherwise blurry design and the cones of 044 resembling beams from lighthouses made me think about refraction as a mechanism. This returns to the simpler background of 042 but randomly places circles on the design which rotate the artwork; in areas where multiple circles overlap the refraction effect is compounded resulting in a glitchy look. I think this mechanic can create some beautiful, distinct designs but the placement of the spinning circles has a huge influence on their effectiveness.

Solving this jigsaw was incredibly fun. I enjoyed following the edges of the refracted circles but also had the colour areas and the piece shapes to go off of. I think I've almost reached the platonic ideal of this series of voronoi-generated puzzles.
