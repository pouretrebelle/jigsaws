# 043

This design evolves from the blurry colourscapes of 042 with much more intentionality about the layering and blending of colours, inspired by [Zach Lieberman](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/)'s recent colour blending sketches. The spots lean to one side instead of expanding outwards from the centre, creating a composition of circles falling in and out of focus. I really like the astronomical vibe to the result but I'm finding the randomised colour palette a little too saturated and often clashing.

The addition of the sharp circle edges added a lot of intrigue to the individual pieces but didn't significantly influence how I went about solving the puzzle. Beyond broad swathes of colour I was more likely to look at matching the edge shape rather that the colour gradation of the piece itself. I think that's more an indication that the piece distribution and cut algorithm are working really well rather than a slight on this design, but it'll be interesting to keep the same piece shapes and experiment with what sort of visual design can have a more dominant effect on how I approach the solve.
