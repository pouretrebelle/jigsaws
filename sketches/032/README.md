# 032

In this design I made the gap between the bars match the width of a single bar and tweaked the fidelity so there's less change horizontally across the design but lots of vertical layering. I think the mix of one, three, five, and seven-across bars create an interesting overlaying effect and their curved ends subtly compliment the more prominent motif of stripes.

I found this puzzle much more difficult to solve than anticipated. It was easy to group the pieces by colour (horizontally) but that didn't match with the easiest way to line up and connect the pieces (vertically).
