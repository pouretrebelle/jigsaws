# 011

In this small evolution from 010 the strokes are much longer and thinner, often with four or five strokes passing through a single piece. This made the puzzle much harder to solve as each piece felt like it could belong anywhere on the board. I tried to follow the path of the longest, darkest strokes, but even these weren't differentiated enough in colour, thickness or curvature to be easy to piece together.
