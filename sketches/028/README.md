This design introduces a third shape layer, 3x the fidelity of the first layer, and uses circles, pills, and quatrefoil shapes. I made the lines divide the shapes rather than sit on top of them, highlighting the arrangement of the shapes on the grid rather than overpowering them.

Similarly to my last 2 puzzles, I started this solve by fitting together the brightest colours. Due to the granularity of the shapes this resulted in lots of small islands of assembled pieces, it was fun and a little confusing to figure out how they all fit together.
