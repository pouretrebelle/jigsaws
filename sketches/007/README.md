Returning to simpler forms, a happy accident while trying to make mirrored pairs of worms led to this block-colour design. The jagged edges from worm clashes appear sparingly; brash colours and simple curves are the primary features of the design.

Unlike the dense textures of the previous few puzzles, this pattern was more pure - the solve relying entirely on matching neigbouring colours, made more difficult by the restricted colour palette.
