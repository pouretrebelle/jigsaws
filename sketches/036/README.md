# 036

The design for this puzzle uses a variation of the 034 design of recursively rotating and shrinking diamonds, with a much more shallow rotation, bigger size, and a low-opacity fill instead of stroke. It uses a standard cut layout but with mini-puzzles hidden inside, ranging from 1×3 to 5×5.

Unlike 035 where I could solve all the mini puzzles first, this layout was a confusing mishmash of 1- 2- 3- and 4-sided pieces. I had to unlearn what each of these piece types meant and concentrate only on the design and single edge by single edge.

More so than any puzzle I've done so far I felt this was an interesting study into subverting the expectations of what a jigsaw puzzle is and how they're meant to be solved.

I'm enjoying playing with the format of the jigsaw while maintaining what mostly look like standard pieces - it's reminiscent of [Yuu Asaka's Jigsaw Puzzle 29](https://puzzlescore.com/en/brands/yuu-asaka/), considered an extremely hard puzzle to solve at only 29 pieces, complicated by containing 5 corners. I'm looking forward to more of this sort of deception.
