# 027

Evolving from 026, this design is on a smaller grid and uses a different set of shapes - circles, squares with two or three rounded corners, and [quatrefoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrefoil). I really like how the quatrefoil extends out of its grid cell and overlaps with the shapes around it (much like the buggy-but-it-looks-nice-that-way squares in 026). There's a higher chance of more plain pieces because of the larger shapes and higher piece count, so I added another layer of randomly-placed jointed lines across the design for an extra visual element.

Because the lines are so prominent I focused on connecting them during the solve instead of grouping areas of colour and connecting the edges of the shapes, which was a little disappointing.
