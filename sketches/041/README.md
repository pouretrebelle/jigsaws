# 041

The design for this puzzle uses the same colour band algorithm I've been working on since 038. It has more rows than columns so the angles aren't 45 degrees, and adds a subtle grid overlay as well as some distortion for craggier edges, it feels a lot more topological than the previous iterations.

The cut algorithm is the same as 040 but the noise field which determines the piece centers has much more macro distortion, which means that some areas of the puzzle have giant pieces and some have tiny pieces.

I found the solve more boring than expected because of the linearity of solving colour band by band, I wish I'd picked a design that had more visual complexity in it. Despite that, I absolutely loved the variation in piece sizes, and the grid on the design added a counter-intuitive element which was refreshing.
