# 017

In this design the strokes expand to fill the empty space, creating eerie, almost biological forms. This inverts the colours of 016 with a luminous light-on-dark palette.

I found it fun to match the more-isolated groups of colour together before connecting all the edge pieces of the puzzle and work outwards from there.
