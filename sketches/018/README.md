# 018

![canvas](https://res.cloudinary.com/abstract-puzzles/image/upload/w_2000/018_ico-omr-mlv-vwi_fdn-bay-xlt-ire?raw=true)

Instead of the solid colour strokes in 017 and 018, this turns them into spines where the rounded spokes fill out the width of the stroke.

I selected a design for the puzzle which had a very distinct gradient running across it, making it much easier to put together from one side rather than doing all the edge pieces first.
