# 008

Similar to the simple block-colour design of 007 but where the thickness of each mirrored worm varies along its path, resulting in glutinous, yonic forms.

Although the shapes created with this design feel very different to 007, the resultant jigsaw solve felt extremely similar, paying attention solely to how the curves separate the contrasting colours.
