# 005

Evolving from 004, this design uses square instead of circular worms. Each piece has lines at right angles with varying thicknesses and offsets.

The constraints in this design made it a delightful puzzle to solve; the limited colour pallette loosely groups areas of the puzzle, but the gradation of the lines and edges where the two orientations meet were the keys to solving it.
