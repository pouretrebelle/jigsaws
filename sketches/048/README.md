In this design I’m using a grid of rotated squares rather than randomly-placed circles so the output is much more angular. I found that with a simpler refraction effect the blurred-circle background wasn’t having the same impact, so instead I used smears of different colours to make the background image. I think this blended the colours more seamlessly and added more intrigue across the design, especially in pastel-coloured outputs.
