Alongside the flow fields technique of the previous two designs, this design uses circle packing to fill in the spaces between the strokes, each circle picking its colour from the closest strokes.

Although the dots add a lot to the visual feel of the design, when it came to solving the puzzle they were of little importance, or even a distraction as they sometimes looked deceivingly like the end of a stroke. Chiefly this puzzle was solved by finding pieces that each had two colours of strokes and forming lines between them.
