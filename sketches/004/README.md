# 004

Similarly to 002, this design has worms exploding from the centre, but the shadow points away from the worms' starting point. With a tight gap between the two offset circles the resulting crescents are much more defined.

This puzzles presented an interesting challenge because almost all the pieces are the single background colour, with only five foreground colours to differentiate between. Solving the puzzle was largely contingent on matching up the highlighted edges of the curves and matching orientations between the crescents.
