This design uses exactly the same algorithm as 049 but with much chunkier rotated lines. I love this visual effect, it envelopes me in warm invented memories like looking up at the sun from under the sea or smelling a gorgeous bouquet of flowers gifted by a lover.

In 022 to 025 I was exploring painting with code, making digital brushstrokes with thousands of tiny circles. This algorithm feels more true to digital painting to me; its clearly-perfect lines and curves are appropriately technical, but the expressiveness of the colours and composition speak to an intention thatâ€™s rooted in a human perception of beauty.

Although, as a puzzle, it was not particularly effective because the colours had undefined zones which led to frustration. I often find myself taken by a beautiful design without thinking about the implications on the enjoyment of the puzzle; this could have been massively improved by adding more variation in the size and shape of the pieces to compensate for the simplicity of the surface design.
