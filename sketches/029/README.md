# 029

This design adds a background grid which is slowly faded out with each layered shape. I removed the lines which divided the shapes in 028, but left the margin between the foreground shapes in place. I really like that this foreground grid is hinted at where the shape edges run parallel, it's a subtle network of whitespace across the design. Also, hearts!

I really enjoyed solving this puzzle with its rich range of colours and textures. Similarly to 027 I was drawn to assembling the areas with obvious lines first, but as that only covered a small portion of the puzzle I was then forced to look at colour groupings and shape edges to fill in the rest.
