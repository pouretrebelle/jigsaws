This design daubs short, thick brushstrokes on the digital canvas. I thought its basic colour groupings would make for quite an easy and boring puzzle, but I was surprised how the subtle changes in colours and the soft edges between the blotches made is great to solve. I was stumped towards the end with the larger planes of light blue but they came together eventually.
