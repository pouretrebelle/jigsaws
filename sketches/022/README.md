This is the start in a series of expressionist paintings using flow fields.

For each stroke a set of bristles is created - small circles randomly arranged within a larger circle, with slightly varying brightnesses. The bristles are dragged across the design in the direction of the flow. The low opacity strokes overlapping create a mottled paintbrush effect.

The outcomes look like they could be made by a toddler splashing paint on a canvas, so decided to lean in to that and opt with bright, clashing poster paint-esque colours.

The resulting puzzle had a good spread of colours, and although the textures of the brushstrokes were quite subtle they helped to guide the solve; overall very enjoyable.
