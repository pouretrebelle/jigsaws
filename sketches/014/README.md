In this design the longest strokes are transparent, leaving thick empty trails in a design otherwise crowded with curves.

I thought leaving gaps in the design would make it really clear which pieces border the empty strokes and provide a skeleton to work from, but the solid green pieces were the hardest to match up (in retrospect, a very obvious consequence), so solving the puzzle relied on finding the thickest pieces and working outwards from there.
