For the last design in this painting series I wanted to focus on the texture of the strokes so reduced the palette to a single colour, and I zoomed in on the flow field to focus on one main sweep across the design.

I think the artwork is exceptionally beautiful, I feel the power in each of the strokes and they look quite realistic, but with a tiny hint of the synthetic. I struggled with how much to vary the lightness of the strokes to make it a solvable puzzle, and think I dissatisfied both sides. The artwork is compromised by artificial highs and lows, while the majority of the puzzle pieces were so samey they were very difficult to place.
