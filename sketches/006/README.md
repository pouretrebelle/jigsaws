# 006

Evolving from the previous two puzzles, this design adds one more degree of orientational complexity by using triangular worms pointing in two directions.

I found the solve less engaging than 005 because the curves were much looser, so there wasn't a lot of variation in the thicknesses of the lines between neighbours. I was largely reliant on grouping colours and orientations rather than being able to pick out neighbouring pieces by eye.
